## About the project
This is a simple project seeking to solve a problem that some friends of mine have with their messy photo gallery folder, grouping all the photos by its creation date into folders.

### How do you know when the photo was created?
The files contain that kind of information withing them, like:
- File type and size
- Description
- Date created
- Camera settings
- Creator and uploader
- Relevant keywords
- Expiration date
- Licensing details
- Restrictions on use
- Rights management information

With these we can group the files however we like, like by "month-year".

### And what if the file doesn't contain the necessary info?
If a creation date is not provided, we simply group them into a "Unknow Date" folder.

## Running the project

While in the root folder, run:
```
python main.py
```
